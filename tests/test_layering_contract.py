"""The import direction inside ``core.calculate``, as a test.

``interfaces.py`` states the rule: a module imports from the layers below it, never
from the ones above.  ``TYPE_CHECKING`` imports are exempt, because they cost nothing
at run time and the annotations name types on purpose.

The framework used to be one cycle of 29 modules — every layer reached every other
through a deferred import — which is why nothing could be imported, tested or reused
alone, and why ``result/signature.py`` could not stop knowing about the node classes.
The edges are now directional; this test is what keeps them that way.

When a new edge is needed in the wrong direction, add a hook to ``interfaces.py``
(a protocol, a factory, a registration) rather than an exception here.  If an
exception is genuinely unavoidable, add it to ``_ALLOWED_UPWARD`` with the reason
in the same commit — an empty list is the goal, and it was reached on 2026-10-14.
